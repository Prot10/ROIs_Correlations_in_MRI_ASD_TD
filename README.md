Group work done for the course of **Statistical Methods in Data Science** (SDS) of the master's degree in [Data Science](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it) at the [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/). All analyzes were performed in [R](https://www.r-project.org).

- `goals_hw_01.pdf` --> the text of the homework.
- `main.html` --> the final file exported in html and without the all code to have a better visualization.
- `main.Rmd` --> the file where all the script is present, it is of type R Markdown.
